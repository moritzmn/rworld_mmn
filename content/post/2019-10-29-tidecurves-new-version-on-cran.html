<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just submitted the new version of <em>TideCurves</em> to <em>CRAN</em>. You should be able to download version 0.0.4 in the following days.
In the previous version 0.0.3 we used a set of 43 partial tides. This set has now been updated by Andreas Boesch and Sylvin Mueller-Navarra. In version 0.0.4 we use a new set of 39 partial tides. Please look out for the new version on <em>CRAN</em>. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TideCurves/index.html" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TideCurves/index.html</a> and a new post explaining the usage of this package. The <em>TideTables</em> package, currently in version 0.0.2, will also be updatet in the next week(s).</p>
<p>See you soon!
Moritz</p>

Hi,

I just submitted the new version of *TideCurves* to *CRAN*. You should be able to download version 0.0.4 in the following days.
In the previous version 0.0.3 we used a set of 43 partial tides. This set has now been updated by Andreas Boesch and Sylvin Mueller-Navarra. In version 0.0.4 we use a new set of 39 partial tides. Please look out for the new version on *CRAN*. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TideCurves/index.html> and a new post explaining the usage of this package. The *TideTables* package, currently in version 0.0.2, will also be updatet in the next week(s).

See you soon!
Moritz

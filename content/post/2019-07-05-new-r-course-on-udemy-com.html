<p>The first real post and already a shameless plug for my <strong>R course</strong> on <a href="https://www.udemy.com" class="uri">https://www.udemy.com</a> â€¦
As I just uploaded the course I thought, you might be interested in taking this course,
where I talk about the basics of <strong>R</strong> for beginners. Unfortunately the course is in german for now,
but I am going to add english subtitles as soon as I figured out how to correctly use <strong>Amazon Transcribe</strong> with <strong>R</strong> to generate german subtitles with a timestamp, which I can then translate into english. I will post more on this topic later this week. Back to the course, as this is a plug for it ;-)</p>
<p>I mainly teach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basics of the R language</li>
<li>Intro to <strong>tidyverse</strong></li>
<li>Intro to <strong>data.table</strong></li>
<li>Plots (<strong>base</strong>, <strong>ggplot2</strong>, <strong>plotly</strong>)</li>
<li>Intro to <strong>shiny</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As for as I know <strong>data.table</strong> has been unrecognized (correct me if I am wrong) by most of the instructors of <strong>udemy</strong> who are teaching <strong>R</strong>, despite being one of the best package for R! I cover the basics of the package. If you need an intro to <strong>data.table</strong>, consider taking my course :-).</p>
<p>Most of the code you will encounter on this blog will start with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(data.table)</code></pre>
<p>Anyway, you finde my course under this link: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/r-basics-u/" class="uri">https://www.udemy.com/r-basics-u/</a>, it is called<br />
<strong>R Basics - Programmierung und Datenanalyse</strong>. Using this link you get the course for 9.99$
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/r-basics-u/?couponCode=WELCOME_R_KURS" class="uri">https://www.udemy.com/r-basics-u/?couponCode=WELCOME_R_KURS</a>, limited to the first 50 subscribers!</p>
<p>See you soon!<br />
Moritz</p>

I am a freelancer applying Data Science using *R*. I studied engineering and economics and have an advanced university degree, which is called *Dipl.-Ing. oec.* from the *Technical University Hamburg*. The degree is equivalent to an Masters degree (engineering & economics) today. I started using *R* during my advanced statistics courses and instantly fell in love with it. For my thesis I used *R* to train partial recurrent neural networks for time series forecasting. Since then I never stopped using *R* for Machine Learning & Data Science, now working as freelancer.  

I believe that interacting with other programmers is fundamental to improving your skills. I constantly visit *R* conferences to learn new skills and meet with other *R* developers. 

In the past years my projects focused around tidal data and offshore wind energy.  
Currently I am exploring the world of Cloud Computing using R.

Furthermore I like do any kind of sports and recently started doing yoga.

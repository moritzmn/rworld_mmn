I am a freelancer applying Data Science using *R*. I studied engineering and economics and have an advanced university degree, which is called *Dipl.-Ing. oec.* from the *Technical University Hamburg*. The degree is equivalent to an Masters degree (engineering & economics) today. I started using *R* during my advanced statistics courses and instantly fell in love with it. For my thesis I used *R* to train partial recurrent neural networks for time series forecasting. Since then I never stopped using *R* for Machine Learning & Data Science, now working as freelancer.  

I believe that interacting with other programmers is fundamental to improving your skills. I constantly visit *R* conferences (UseR! 2017 Brussels, eRum2018 Budapest and SatRday 2019 in Berlin) to learn new skills and meet with other *R* developers. 

In the past years my projects focused around tidal data and offshore windenergy.  
In my spare time I work on Mobile Apps with *Java* and recently *Dart* using the *Flutter* Framework. 

Furthermore I like do any kind of sports and recently started doing yoga.
